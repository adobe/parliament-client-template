# parliament-client-template

## ðŸš€ Quick start
### Prerequisites
1. `node`: Use a version between 14.15 and 16 (e.g., if using nvm, type `nvm use 14.17.5`)
2. `yarn`
3. `git`

### Steps
1. **Clone your docs repo**

   ```sh
   git clone git@github.com:org/repo
   ```

1. **Clone this repo**

   ```sh
   git clone git@github.com:adobe/parliament-client-template.git
   cd parliament-client-template
   ```

1. **Install dependencies**

   ```sh
   yarn install
   ```

1. **Create an environment File**

   Create a `.env.development` (local) or `.env.production` (prod) file and define environment variables as below. 

   For local:

   ```
   GATSBY_SITE_PATH_PREFIX = Demo
   
   # Personal access token with read access created from Github Enterprise (https://git.corp.adobe.com)
   # Instructions: https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line
   GATSBY_GIT_CORP_TOKEN = 1cdba7077XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX633c1

   # Site repo URL which you want to use to generate a microsite
   # NOTE: This MUST be the FULL HTTPS URL
   #       This repository must contain a manifest*.* file for Parliament to read.
   #       (preferably in a .yaml format)
   # For development/testing, the following sample repo can be used: https://github.com/AdobeDocs/parliament-docs-template
   GATSBY_SOURCE=https://github.com/<source_org>/<source_repo>
   GATSBY_SOURCE_BRANCH=master

   # Strings starting with a "!" are considered ignore patterns. For example !CONTRIBUTING.md will tell the system to skip CONTRIBUTING.md
   GATSBY_SOURCE_PATTERNS=**/*,!CONTRIBUTING.md
   GATSBY_SOURCE_TITLE=My Docs Site

   # NOTE: LOCAL_PROJECT_DIRECTORY is the absolute path to a local copy of the repository specified in $GATSBY_SOURCE
   LOCAL_PROJECT_DIRECTORY=/absolute/path/to/docs/project
   SWAGGER_SOURCE_PATTERNS=**/petstore.json,**/swagger.json

   # URL for your analytics script (optional)
   GATSBY_LAUNCH_SRC=//assets.adobedtm.com/<id>/launch-<id>.min.js
   
   # used to mock out features that require a username
   LDAP_USER=<your LDAP>
   ```

   For Jenkins:

   ```
   GATSBY_GIT_CORP_TOKEN = credentials('TOKEN')
   # Repo URL in given format which you want to use to generate a microsite
   GATSBY_SOURCE = 'github.com/<source_org>/<source_repo>.git'
   # Repo URL in given format where you want to host the static html build output from Gatsby for Gihub Pages
   GATSBY_TARGET = 'github.com/<target_org>/<target_repo>.git'
   GATSBY_SITE_PATH_PREFIX = '/pages/<target_org>/<target_repo>' // Path Prefix for link relationship to work
   GATSBY_SOURCE_BRANCH=master
   # Strings starting with a "!" are considered ignore patterns. For example !CONTRIBUTING.md will tell the system to skip CONTRIBUTING.md
   GATSBY_SOURCE_PATTERNS=**/*,!CONTRIBUTING.md
   GATSBY_SOURCE_TITLE=My Docs Site
   # Url for your analytics script
   GATSBY_LAUNCH_SRC=//assets.adobedtm.com/<id>/launch-<id>.min.js
   LOCAL_PROJECT_DIRECTORY=/absolute/path/to/docs/project
   SWAGGER_SOURCE_PATTERNS=**/petstore.json,**/swagger.json
   ```

1. **Clean environment**

   If you have previously built a production site or switching to a new local project, run this command to remove the `.cache` directory.

   ```sh
   yarn run clean
   ```

1. **Start developing/authoring**

   Start a local instance of this project using the following command:

   ```sh
   yarn run develop
   ```

1. **Open the source code and start editing!**

   Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

   _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

   Open the `my-default-starter` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

## âœ… Testing

### Development

1. **Run unit tests**

   ```sh
   yarn run test:integration
   ```

2. ** Run end to end tests**

   ```sh
   gatsby clean
   yarn run test:e2e
   ```

### Production

To simulate production tests first set the environment variable `GATSBY_SITE_PATH_PREFIX` locally as it is required for production tests to run properly.

1. **Run unit tests**

```sh
yarn run test:integration
```

2. ** Run end to end tests**

   ```sh
   gatsby clean
   yarn run build:prod
   yarn run test:e2e:ci
   ```
